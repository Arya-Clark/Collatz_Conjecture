# Collatz_Conjecture
A Python script to test whether an integer input behaves in accordance with the Collatz Conjecture.
The Collatz Conjecture works as follows:
For any starting integer, N:
if N is odd, multiply it by 3, then add one. The result becomes the new N.
if N is even, divide by 2. This result becomes the new N.
For any given starting point, the result will always reduce to 1.

The script will measure how many steps were taken to reduce the value to 1, and print all the operations.
